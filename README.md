Welcome! This is a template git repository for creating REPRODUCIBLE Underworld code based projects.

REPRODUCIBLE because this project:
1. Is stored in a git repository.
2. Uses a Dockerfile to recreate the exact project environment.

The two features above enable the project to take advantage of software engineering and open source principles, such as:
_version control_, _reproducible environments_, _collaboration_ (Pull Requests, Binderhub), _continuous integration_. 

(See https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/, for a general introduction to these principle. N.B. it is data-science focussed)  

*Welcome to Underworld community projects.*

You can use this repository as a GitHub template to start a new repository of your own that matches the requirements of the underworld-community. To get started, hit the "Use this template" button above. See this [quick start guide]( https://github.com/underworld-community/template-project/wiki/Quick-start) for more information.

Please replace this README with information about your own repository.
